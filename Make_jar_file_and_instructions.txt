Because the website that is needed for downloading JDK8 was under technical difficulties it lead to me not being able to create a runnable
jar file so this will instruct you how to make it. you need jdk8 (Java development kit 8)

1. Download intellijIDEA
2. Open project in IntellijIDEA
3. click file
4. click project structure
5. click artifacts
6. click the little "+" buttom
7. click create with module dependencies
8. choose main class
9. click apply
10. click ok
11. click on build on the top bar
12. click build artifact
13. click build

then in out folder a jar file is found copy and paste it in other locatiion,  go to that location in cmd and type

"java -jar Boatclub.jar"

Also remove/edit boat is not working currently other than that everything is working.
